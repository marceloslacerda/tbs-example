tbs example
===========

A project to demonstrate tbs capabilities with some sample scripts and
some basic configuration.

Use [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/) to install the dependencies and
run it with [fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/) (`fab run`) in the root
directory of this project.

The run function goes over a few environment variables and set them for
you. If you want to use this in production, make sure that the variables
are set before running fabric.

For more instructions on what each variable does check
[tbs README](https://github.com/marceloslacerda/tbs/blob/master/README.rst).
